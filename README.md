Welcome to our university project showcasing a fully handcrafted IoT server, controller, and web interface.

### Overview

Our project is an IoT system designed to facilitate seamless communication between devices and users. The system comprises three main components: the IoT server, the controller, and the web interface.

### Key Features

- **IoT Server**: Our custom-built IoT server serves as the backbone of the entire system. It efficiently handles device connections, data processing, and real-time communication.

- **Controller**: The intuitive controller empowers users to interact with their IoT devices effortlessly. It supports a wide range of device types and allows users to manage their connected devices seamlessly.

- **Web Interface**: Our user-friendly web interface provides a visually appealing dashboard to monitor and control IoT devices from any device with internet access. Users can easily access and manage their IoT network from anywhere in the world.

### How to Use

1. Start by deploying the IoT server on your preferred platform. Refer to the detailed installation guide in the `server/README.md` for step-by-step instructions.

2. Next, set up the controller to connect your IoT devices to the server. Detailed setup instructions can be found in the `controller/README.md`.

3. Finally, access the web interface by following the instructions in the `web_interface/README.md`. You'll be able to manage your IoT network seamlessly through a user-friendly interface.
